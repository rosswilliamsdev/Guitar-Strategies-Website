                In a short time, if you’re not careful, you will never be a beginner again. New beginnings are a unique experience free from the burden of expectation and muscle memory, while simultaneously offering the excitement of the unknown and the joy of discovery. As your journey further into music unfolds before you, take time to note your openness to novelty, your attention when a lesson is happening, and your focus on only the most immediate of tasks. These are but some of the advantages that rest in the mind of a beginner.

                The earnestness of a new guitarist is something to behold: they scour the internet for the best sources of knowledge, they tell anyone who will listen about their new instrument, and they have also been spotted furrowing their brow in concentration after sitting down for their first guitar lesson. Music teachers everywhere can attest to the conviction of those students who sought out lessons on their own. You are one of those students. While this resource might not show you the proper finger placement in a barre chord, it will refresh your mind and prepare it for the lessons to come. In time, you will find that preparation itself will help generate learning opportunities for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this seminal moment for you and your guitar, be mindful that you are teaching yourself a new way of learning. This method will take time to develop, but it is also informed by your learning habits in other areas of life. This is an opportunity for you to be purposeful in your formative habits. Take it! Take your time, be easy on yourself when mistakes are made, and most of all stay in touch with the joy of music and the learning process. As long as you continue on your journey, you will get to wherever you wish to go. You will also discover new vistas that will change your perspective on places you have already been. Wherever your curiosity takes you, just remember to bring along your beginner’s mind.

            <h3>Questions & Strategies For Maintaining Beginner's Mind</h3>
            <ul class="bullet_points">
                <li>What about guitar attracts your curiosity?</li>
                <p>
                <li>
                    Can you remember what you thought it would be like to play guitar the way you wanted? Reimagine it as vividly as possible. What skills/techniques do you need to fulfill that vision? Write them out and examine how interested you are in pursuing them now.
                </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li>
                    When is the last time you took a guitar lesson in person? Seek out a local guitarist you admire and ask them for a lesson. Even if they don’t teach, ask if they would do just one under whatever circumstances you both feel comfortable with.
                </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li>
                    Is there anything about guitar that seems impossible to you? If it is technical, try for the smallest possible excerpt (i.e. one repetition of a tapped arpeggio), if it is tonal, research the equipment needed and approximate it at home. If not possible at home, try it at a music store (with respect given to your surroundings). If you can’t begin to make headway on whatever it is, go to a music store, an open mic, or a local show and ask your fellow musicians what they think. 
                </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li>
                    There are always styles/genres we are still beginners in. Choose a style you rarely play and learn a song. This is not to expand your repertoire or even to learn the song, but for you to evaluate your methods of learning. Take note of your learning techniques and habits and see how they can be improved.

        <h2 class="blog_title">Frequency of Play</h2>
        <section class="blog_post">
            <span><em><q>Practice only on the days you eat.</q></em> - Shinichi Suzuki</span>
            <p>
                The level of profundity we derive from music is in some ways related to the length of exposure we have to it. Like the Hubble space telescope, when given enough time our minds discover secret galaxies of sound layered underneath what seemed like a vacant silence only moments before: the ticking of a wristwatch becomes a swinging metronome, a droning vacuum has its own key to hum a melody over. When we welcome our practice into daily routine, we begin to think in music. If you’ve ever wondered why some people just seem like natural musicians, how often they play is a crucial factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice the subject of this chapter is about <em>frequency</em>, not how long your practices are. The difference in results is easy to spot: it is the difference between certainty and uncertainty, between speaking confidently and looking up every word you have to say in the dictionary. Making up for lost practice time with long hours is like trying to learn a language a month before studying abroad. Invariably, the tremendous effort coupled with a lack of lasting results leads to burnout. In so doing we push ourselves too hard and develop bad habits as we gradually lose focus.  If you miss a day or two, it is better to set short-term goals and resolve to achieve them instead of playing twice as long tomorrow. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Know that there is no amount of time required for practice to count. <strong>As long as you have made space for your music and devoted your full attention to it, progress will happen.</strong> You have your entire life to traverse your musical path, so take time to build the habits you know will serve you best. Be deliberate, follow through, do your best, and do better than yesterday. If that’s all you ever learn from the guitar, it will have been time well spent.
