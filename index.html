    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <section class="index">
        <p>Whether you're learning guitar for the first time or an experienced musician, the strategies and information
            presented here will increase your skill level and knowledge base.
            The only conditions are <em>frequency,</em> <em>consistency,</em> and <em>attention to detail</em>. Let's
            define what these terms mean:</p>
        <h4>Frequency is:</h4>
        <ul class="bullet_points">
            <li>Playing more days than not (at minimum)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The more often you play, the faster you'll improve</li>
                <li>Best practice is to play everyday</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Consistency is:</h4>
        <ul class="bullet_points">
            <li>Playing the same things</li>
            <li>The same way</li>
            <li>Everytime you play</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Attention to detail is:</h4>
        <ul class="bullet_points">
            <li>Playing the right notes</li>
            <li>articulations</li>
            <li>and rhythms</li>
            <li>with the right fingerings</li>
            <li>in the right position</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you practice frequently, consistently, and pay attention to detail, your listening skills will improve
            dramatically. You'll hear every sound around you, not just music, with more clarity.
            You'll also learn to notice the relationships between sounds and how they function in different contexts.
            This means as you develop your skills,
            new levels of sonic detail will reveal themselves to you. Consider it a calling to express these new sounds
            on your instrument.

        <h2>Foundations For Learning</h2>
        <p>
            For learning to take place a student must be focused, without envrionmental distractions, and they must get
            <em>immediate, accurate feedback</em> for their actions. In order to get quality feedback, you need to have
            a clear reference to compare yourself to. The best reference will always be a recording, with written music
            being a distant second. But there is more to it than that. Memorization is a core component to both how well
            you play and how fast you learn music, and what you memorize becomes an internal reference for your playing.
            The process of memorization is happening whether you explicitly do it or not. <strong>The fastest method for
                memorizing music is learning to sing or hum what you hear</strong>. As an old mentor liked to tell me
            <q><em>If you can say it, you can play it!</em></q> However, any exposure is contributing to memorization,
            so simply listening to the music you want to learn will help as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The choice is this: either you try memorizing things while you practice, and risk creating bad habits you’ll
            have to unlearn, or you memorize the music before you even touch your instrument and have a clear goal in
            mind when you start playing. In my years of experience, the evidence of this is clear: students will learn
            their favorite songs much faster than music they are unfamiliar with. This even accounts for things like
            musical complexity, passion, and the skill level of the student. Even after you begin practicing a piece of
            music, reference recordings as often as possible to ensure accuracy.
        </p>
        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        Now that the foundation has been set, it is time to talk about the mother of learning: repetition. Notice
        there’s a fair bit of writing before this subject! That’s because repetition is a double-edged sword that can
        propel you to the next level or hold you back. What’s important to remember with each rep is you’re using your
        mind to train the muscles in your hands. Your muscles don’t discriminate between a right or wrong movement, but
        your mind does! I find that even with advanced topics, most students grasp things mentally in virtually no time
        at all. But when it comes to application, things can take quite a while before they can be played easily.
        Repetition will close the gap, but there is some nuance to what makes a quality rep.
        <p>
            Show your hands each movement <em>exactly</em> the way you want it done. Take it slow at first and take
            nothing for granted! A whole sequence of movements is required to produce even one note of music, so go
            through each part mindfully. As you gain familiarity, things will come more easily and you’ll be able to
            play with more control. A common view among guitarists is that speed is king. <strong>Speed is an outcome of
                <em>control</em>!</strong> You gain control over your playing through many quality reps. Which begs the
            question: how many reps?
        </p>
        <p>
            As few as necessary, but as many as it takes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The funny thing about practice is it always seems like a huge investment before you do it and easier than it
            should be after you’ve finished. What if I told you it would take 250 reps to learn that complicated guitar
            part you like? What if I told you it took about five to 10 minutes of practice? Believe it or not, they are
            about the same! There are quite a few parts I’ve learned and taught myself that have taken just that long.
            If we look only at the upfront investment (250 reps) we miss that it is relatively attainable (only a few
            minutes time). This is but one example of why it is crucial to approach learning with a growth mindset.
            Remember:
        </p>
        <p>
            As few as necessary, but as many as it takes!
        </p>
        <h3>A Word About TABs</h3>
        <p>TABs are essentially the Wikipedia of guitar playing. They are almost always done by fans, and are not
            checked for accuracy before being posted. When using TABs, it's critical to reference a recording often to
            make sure the TAB is accurate. They often are not! It's important to remember that TABs often offer no
            rhythmic information, so it is usually impossible to tell how the notes should be played from the TAB alone.
            You need to already know how the music goes for TABs to be useful! Ultimately, TABs are a useful shorthand
            for learning guitar parts, but be conscious of their limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, remember that TABs are only a means to help you memorize and understand music. Once you get the
            notes correct, turn your attention away from the page and toward your guitar. Too often, I see students
            plunk away one note at a time with their eyes glued to the page, ignoring the fact that they sound nothing
            like the music they're trying to learn. Music is much more than the notes you play, which is why you need to
            pay attention to detail and reference recordings often when practicing.
