        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <section class="index">
            <p>Whether you're learning guitar for the first time or an experienced musician, the strategies and information presented here will increase your skill level and knowledge base.
        The only conditions are <em>frequency,</em> <em>consistency,</em> and <em>attention to detail</em>. Let's define what these terms mean:</p>
        <h4>Frequency is:</h4>    
            <ul class="bullet_points">
                <li>Playing more days than not (at minimum)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The more often you play, the faster you'll improve</li>
                    <li>Best practice is to play everyday</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <h4>Consistency is:</h4>
                <ul class="bullet_points">
                    <li>Playing the same things</li>
                    <li>The same way</li>
                    <li>Everytime you play</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Attention to detail is:</h4>
                <ul class="bullet_points">
                    <li>Playing the right notes</li>
                    <li>articulations</li>
                    <li>and rhythms</li>
                    <li>with the right fingerings</li>
                    <li>in the right position</li>
                </ul>
            <p>If you practice frequently, consistently, and pay attention to detail, your listening skills will improve dramatically. You'll hear every sound around you, not just music, with more clarity. 
            You'll also learn to notice the relationships between sounds and how they function in different contexts. This means as you develop your skills, 
            new levels of sonic detail will reveal themselves to you. Consider it a calling to express these new sounds on your instrument.

            <h2>Foundations for learning</h2>
            <p>
            For learning to take place, a student must have <em>immediate, accurate feedback</em>. This is why memorization is the absolute bedrock of learning music: you <strong>must</strong> have a clear reference to compare your playing against to progress quickly. The fastest method for memorizing music is learning to sing or hum what you hear. As an old mentor liked to tell me <q><strong>If you can say it, you can play it!</strong></q>
            </p>
            <p>I must stress this:</p>
            <p>
            The process of memorization is happening whether you explicitly do it or not. The choice is this: either you try memorizing things while you practice, and risk creating bad habits youâ€™ll have to unlearn, or you memorize the music before you even touch your instrument and have a clear goal in mind when you start playing. In my years of experience, the evidence of this is clear: students will learn their favorite songs much faster than music they are unfamiliar with. This even accounts for things like musical complexity, passion, and the skill level of the student. Even after you begin practicing a piece of music, reference recordings as often as possible to ensure accuracy.
