        <p class="p-music">Wild Eye strikes a zen-like balance between the psychedelic rock and folk sounds of past and
            present. Turn up your headphones to find a fingerpicked guitar magically fitting alongside hushed mantras
            and face-melting guitar solos. The binding element is Ross Williams, who I Heart Local Music proclaimed to
            have “One of the prettiest voices on the scene”. His skillful modern production is the final alchemical
            ingredient that makes Wild Eye a rare pleasure: an artist who’s painstakingly crafted a singular voice to
            push the art and expand the mind.
        </p>
        <p class="p-music">
            Wild Eye’s performances span from Austin, Texas as part of the Midcoast Takeover, to opening for national
            touring acts such as The Spirit of the Beehive, as well as sharing bills with local favorites like Calvin
            Arsenia, Mysterious Clouds, Akkilles, and more.

            I was looking for a drummer for a different band (This Evil) and Nick (drums) came over to jam, and
            somewhere in that session my roommate James came by and asked if he could play bass. Our chemistry was
            powerful and immediate! It was clear that we <em>had</em> to start a new band with this lineup. And so No
            Cave began.
        </p>
        <p>
            James and I had been jamming often and were heavily inspired by the krautrock of 70's Germany. We wanted
            to bring that sense of open experimentation to the new group. Nick came from a background in math rock and
            midwest emo, bringing that intense energy to our spaced-out jams. From our formation we spent a lot of
            our time improvising and piecing together songs- the main method used in
            the composition style of our favorite bands like Can, Harmonia, and Neu. We eventually had enough material
            to start playing live, and audiences responded well to our blend of styles.

            The songwriting project of Joel Stratton, I played bass in the live band. I also recorded, produced, mixed,
            and mastered the eponymous Tropic of Leo EP. Very fun and challenging pop music to play! I remember Joel was
            very inspired by Big Star as well as modern one man band's like Tame Impala (Kevin Parker) and Mac Demarco
            at the time. This is probably my best work playing bass.
