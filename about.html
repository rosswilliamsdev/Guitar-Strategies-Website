        <p class="educational_background">
            I began my journey as a musician when I was gifted guitar lessons on my 15th birthday.
            I had no special gift for music, and being the only musician in my family, I had no real exposure to music
            beyond
            the mainstream hits of the time. I grew up on 90’s pop country (Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain,
            etc), rock,
            and pop music. For the first year or so of lessons, I practiced some but didn’t take it too seriously.
            The height of my interest at the time was learning the guitar parts to my favorite pop-punk songs.

        <p class="educational_background">
            Then, in my senior year of high school, my best friend (a gifted pianist) told me he was auditioning for a
            spot at a
            prestigious music school. At the time I was transitioning out of playing sports year-round and wasn’t sure
            what I wanted
            to do for college (I am also a first-generation college student). I looked up the audition requirements for
            the music
            school and it finally clicked for me: do these things well, and you’re in. For the next year, I basically
            locked
            myself in my room to study those audition requirements: scales, sight reading, ear training, classical
            guitar, and a
            performance piece. With help from my guitar teacher, I passed the audition! However, my friend and I both
            decided not
            to go as it was prohibitively expensive, even with a small scholarship. I opted to accept a full-ride
            scholarship at a
            community college closer to home.
        </p>
        <p class="educational_background">
            From there I was swept into the college experience of music: jazz combos, big bands, choir, madrigals, voice
            lessons,
            piano classes, music history classes, performances, clinics, traveling, and more. I had my share of
            formative experiences
            and plenty of failures too, but I’m grateful for all the friends and mentors I made along the way. I started
            my first band based on my own original music with friends I made in jazz band around 2010. Ever since then,
            we have been playing in
            each other’s projects in one form or another.
